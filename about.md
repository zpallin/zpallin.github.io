Nothing to see here. Just another fancy personal website.
</p>

<p>
When I was about 9 I got a PC that had access to the internet. It eluded me at first, but soon I learned how to get into chatrooms. I met weird people, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Comic_Chat">did this weird thing</a>, and had an idea for a website.
</p>

<p>
After I had a geocities account setup, I built a small website using html. Its color scheme was akin to Oscar the Grouch. Its purpose was to provide advice to anyone who asked for it. I linked it my AIM profile, and shared it with friends. I got a lot of hits, and it was fun.
</p>

<p>
I haven't really had a personal site since then, so seeing as I work in tech and do techy things, I might as well have a site.
</p>

<p>
It's actually strange that more people don't have their own websites to share things and try stuff out. It's as if people have completely forgotten what made the internet cool in the first place.
</p>

<p>
Well, anyway. If you're reading this, you're probably not that cool anyway.
